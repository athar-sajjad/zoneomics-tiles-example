#   Defining variables to store the colors for the different layers.
#   These can be refenreced as parameters in draw.

# Define the textures that will be used in the redering
# For the POIs icons we will give the textures for each type of the POI
# The pa_dublin, followed by the URL, and then define the sprite (for now the whole png is being used as a sprite
# so we are using 0 as both x and y origin, and the icon itself in 18x18 pixels)
# a different texture object for each icon as the icons are kept in a seperate png file

# Will have to define styles for each icon seperately as the textures can't be directly called in the draw function of the layer
# The style will tell the type of object it can be applied to (points for pois) and the applicable texture file
# if the texture is not referenced in a style, then we will get a error
